  Nuclide is built as a single package on top of Atom to provide hackability and the support of an active community.

  It provides a first-class development environment for React Native, Hack and Flow projects.

# Sometimes you also have a `baseurl:` that determines the subpath of your site. For example if
# you're using an `organisation.github.io/reponame/` basic site URL, then `baseurl` would be set
# as "/reponame/". For no `baseurl`, specifiy an empty string (equivalent to null) a top-level
# domain URL. (Normally you can have empty string, but been having troubles so removing it
# all together - https://github.com/facebook/nuclide/issues/789)

# Build settings
# Github pages now only supports Kramdown and Rouge
# https://github.com/blog/2100-github-pages-now-faster-and-simpler-with-jekyll-3-0
# So no need to be explicit with respect to our markdown and highlighter settings since they
# cannot change.
# kramdown also automatically generates header ID's too. But we remove any auto id suffix
# in a post processing step (js/jekyll-link-anchors.js) to make the links more readable.

# For local development and testing, explicitly set kramdown settings that GitHub does
# https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/#defaults-you-can-change

# Blog posts are built into to Jekyll by default, with the `_posts` directory.
# Here you can specify other types of documentation. The names here are `docs`
# and `top-level`. This means their content will be in `_docs` and `_top-level`.
# The permalink format is also given.
